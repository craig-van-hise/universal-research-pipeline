Binaural Ambisonics: Its optimization and applications for auralization,"Makoto Otani, Haruki Shigetani, Masataka Mitsuishi, Ryo Matsuda",_pdf.pdf,2020/01/01,Unsorted,"To better understand acoustic environment and the resulting auditory perception, it is essential to capture, analyze, and reproduce a sound field as a three-dimensional physical phenomenon because spatial aspects of auditory perception play important roles in various situations in our lives. Some approaches have been proposed to achieve the three-dimensional capture and reproduction of acoustic fields. Among them, Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) based on spherical harmonics expansion enables the capture and reproduction of a directivity pattern of incoming sound waves. On the basis of HOA, three-dimensional auditory space can be presented to a listener typically via a spherical loudspeaker array. In addition, binaural synthesis emulating the loudspeaker presentation enables HOA reproduction with a set of headphones or several loudspeakers by employing crosstalk cancellation. Thus, we are developing an HOA-based binaural reproduction/auralization system with head tracking. This system is aimed at realizing the reproduction and auralization of a sound field, including one excited by the listener's own voice. In this paper, we review the topics related to the reproduction and auralization of the sound field and introduce the HOA-based binaural synthesis system we have developed, as well as our works on sweet-spot expansion in HOA decoding and self-voice reproduction/auralization.",False,False,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ast/41/1/41_E19229/_pdf,10.1250/ast.41.142,OpenAlex

An Efficient Implementation of Parallel Parametric HRTF Models for Binaural Sound Synthesis in Mobile Multimedia,"Jose A. Belloch, Germán Ramos, José M. Badía, Máximo Cobos",09028216.pdf,2020/01/01,Unsorted,"The extended use of mobile multimedia devices in applications like gaming, 3D video and audio reproduction, immersive teleconferencing, or virtual and augmented reality, is demanding efficient algorithms and methodologies. All these applications require real-time spatial audio engines with the capability of dealing with intensive signal processing operations while facing a number of constraints related to computational cost, latency and energy consumption. Most mobile multimedia devices include a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) that is primarily used to accelerate video processing tasks, providing high computational capabilities due to its inherent parallel architecture. This paper describes a scalable parallel implementation of a real-time binaural audio engine for GPU-equipped mobile devices. The engine is based on a set of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) modelled with a parametric parallel structure, allowing efficient synthesis and interpolation while reducing the size required for HRTF data storage. Several strategies to optimize the GPU implementation are evaluated over a well-known kind of processor present in a wide range of mobile devices. In this context, we analyze both the energy consumption and real-time capabilities of the system by exploring different GPU and CPU configuration alternatives. Moreover, the implementation has been conducted using the OpenCL framework, guarantying the portability of the code.",False,False,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09028216.pdf,10.1109/access.2020.2979489,OpenAlex
